# Google Maps Presenter Plugins

A plugin for [COPRL](http://github.com/coprl/coprl) that provides google maps.

The plugin is based on the standard [image component](https://coprl-ruby.herokuapp.com/images) and supports all the same [attributes](https://github.com/coprl/coprl/blob/master/lib/coprl/presenters/dsl/components/image.rb) for styling.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'open_id_presenter_plugin',  github: 'coprl/open_id_presenter_plugin', branch: :main, require: false
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Example POM:

    Coprl::Presenters.define(:google_maps) do
        plugin :google_maps
        page_title 'Maps'
        subheading 'Static Maps'
        
        address = '125 Park Street, Traverse City, MI'
        google_map address: address, height: 300, width: 400  do
            event :click do
                loads "https://www.google.com/maps/place/#{address}"
            end
